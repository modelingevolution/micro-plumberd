/// <summary>
/// Use this attribute on Models where you want to override stream name convention.

/// <remarks>
/// Your read-models/event-handlers typically subscribe to a stream that comes from a merge of event-type streams.
/// If you have a FooModel:
/// <code>
/// [EventHandler]
/// [OutputStream("Foo")]
/// class FooModel {
/// public async Task Given(Metadata m, FooEvent1 ev) { }
/// public async Task Given(Metadata m, FooEvent2 ev) { }
/// }
/// </code>
/// Without the OutputStream attribute a projection would be made in EventStoreDB that produces FooModel stream out of
/// $et-FooEvent1 and $et-FooEvent2. But, since there is the attribute the produced stream will be named 'Foo'.
/// </remarks>
