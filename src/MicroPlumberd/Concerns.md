   - Communication patterns between contexts

2. **Aggregate Roots and Entity Relationships**
   - Handling relationships between aggregates
   - Implementing complex domain models
   - Guidelines for aggregate consistency boundaries

3. **Value Objects**
   - Comprehensive guidance on implementing value objects
   - Integration with the serialization system
   - Common value object patterns

4. **Domain Services**
   - Implementing domain services across multiple aggregates
   - Fitting domain services into the overall architecture
   - Examples of domain service use cases

## CQRS Implementation

1. **Query Side Scalability**
   - Scaling read models independently from command side
   - Distribution strategies for read models
   - Caching strategies for high-performance queries

2. **Command Validation**
   - Comprehensive approach to command validation
   - Implementing validation pipelines or middleware
   - Cross-field and business rule validation

3. **Command Results**
   - Sophisticated command result patterns
   - Handling complex workflows
   - Progressive command feedback

4. **Integration with External Systems**
   - Maintaining CQRS boundaries with external systems
   - Event-driven integration patterns
   - Anti-corruption layers

## Event Sourcing Considerations

1. **Schema Evolution**
   - Handling event schema changes over time
   - Migration strategies
   - Backward and forward compatibility

2. **Event Versioning**
   - Strategies for versioning events
   - Version detection and routing
   - Compatibility matrices

3. **Event Upcasting**
   - Techniques for transforming old event formats
   - Implementation strategies
   - Performance considerations

4. **Dealing with Large Event Streams**
   - Optimizations beyond snapshots
   - Partitioning strategies
   - Archiving old events

5. **Event Replay and System Rebuilding**
   - Strategies for full system rebuilds
   - Partial event replay
   - Read model reconstruction

## General Architecture Concerns

1. **Testing Strategies**
   - Testing aggregates effectively
   - Command handler testing
   - Event handler testing
   - Integration testing

2. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Robust error handling strategies
   - Recovery from distributed operations failures
   - Compensating transactions

3. **Eventual Consistency**
   - Explaining implications of eventual consistency
   - UI patterns for eventual consistency
   - User experience considerations

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Comprehensive performance tuning
   - Benchmarking strategies
   - Scaling guidelines

5. **Monitoring and Debugging**

   - Observability patterns

## Library-Specific Concerns

1. **Learning Curve**
   - Simplifying convention-based mechanisms
   - Better onboarding documentation
   - Getting started tutorials

2. **Configuration Over Convention**
   - Providing more explicit configuration options
   - Escape hatches for convention overrides
   - Flexibility in implementation

3. **Migration from Traditional Systems**
   - Guidance on migrating from CRUD systems
   - Incremental adoption strategies
   - Coexistence patterns

4. **Integration with Other .NET Ecosystem Tools**
   - Integration with identity providers
   - Working with SignalR for real-time updates
   - Integration with metrics and logging systems

These areas will be prioritized for future documentation and development efforts.
